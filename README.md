# 🌐 Computer Networks Projects

This repository contains two hands-on projects developed as part of **CSCI-P538: Computer Networks**, focusing on **application-layer protocols**, **socket programming**, and **web infrastructure concepts**.

---

## 📌 Projects Overview

### 1️⃣ Simple HTTP Server (Project 1)
A lightweight **HTTP/1.1 server built from scratch** using Python TCP sockets.

**Key highlights:**
- Manual parsing of HTTP requests and responses
- Support for GET, POST, PUT, and HEAD methods
- File serving, data persistence, and proper error handling
- Tested using `curl` and web browsers

---

### 2️⃣ Web Cache Proxy Server (Project 2)
An **HTTP proxy server with caching support** that sits between clients and an origin server.

**Key highlights:**
- Transparent request forwarding
- GET response caching with TTL-based freshness
- LRU cache replacement policy
- End-to-end client–proxy–server testing

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Deep understanding of HTTP and TCP socket programming
- Practical experience with client–server architectures
- Implementation of real-world web concepts such as caching and proxies
- Strong foundation in application-layer network protocols
